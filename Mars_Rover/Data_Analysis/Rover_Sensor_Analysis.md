# Mars Rover Sensor Data Analysis

The primary focus of our analysis would be on the temperature and the pressure readings from the barometer.
# Temperature
We observe the temperature readings from the barometer and the internal temperature sensor (IMU.T). The readings from the barometer are highly inaccurate as the 
actual temperature at that time was around 8*C. We will try to explore the source of the error. We notice that there is a strong correlation 
between the IMU readings and the barometer, so it is safe to assume that the error comes from the heat generated by the rover.

Our calibration method is simple; we take the difference in the readings and add a bias value to make the reading closer to the ground truth.

# Pressure

While we couldn't determine the ground truth for the pressure, we did determine the sea level pressure at the time of measurement which was 29.34 inHg which is equivalent to 99367.7 Pa.
The pressure at an altitude higher than sea level should be lower than that at sea level so we can tell the reading is inaccurate.

We hypothesize that the source of the error is because the sea level pressure was not calibrated at the start of the operation. 
However, we can still use the data as is by subtracting a bias value from the reading to get us closer to the ground truth.
