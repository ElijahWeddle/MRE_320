# Mars Rover - Fall 2023 

The Mars Rover a distinct objective: travel a designated path autonomously while recording temperature and humidity data. 

The Mars Rover portion of this repository is broken up into multiple sections: 

    "Arduino_Code_Practice": the code used on the Arduino Mega for temperature and humidity readings. The code includes serial prints to display readings on the computer monitor as well as storing the data in an SD card. This code can be used to verify correct wiring and setups for the Arduino, DHT-11, and SD card.

    "Arduino_Code_Live_Run": the actual code used on the Arduino during testing; this is a version of the Arduino_Code_Practice without the serial prints, only writing DHT-11 data to the SD card. 

    "Data_Analysis": includes all collected data as well as interpretations.

    "Improvements": the parts of the project that Group 1 could have been done better to obtain better results.
