#DHT-11 Data 
This data is displayed in the "DHT-11.pdf" file for easier viewing.

Accuracy: Average deviation of 10 readings = 0.4762 *C
Precision:  Standard deviation of 10 readings = 0.0514 *C
Repeatability: Standard deviation of 8 readings = 0.3082 *C​
Drift: 5 readings spread out by 1minitues at 29 = 0.3 *C
Sensitivity:  0.9083
Linearity: y = 0.9083*x+0.1694         R^2 = 0.10092
Hysteresis: Put it in the refrigerator and froze at –2*C, it measured -0.9*C. Then took it out at room temperature 29*C and it could only measure 26.7*C.​
