# Overview

The DHT-11 sensor is used to measure both temperature and humidity. The temperature is sensed with a thermistor while the humidity sensor uses a capacitance. The thermistor simply increases resistance as temperature increases. The resistance is measured, and a transfer function associates the temperature. The humidity sensor has a hydrogenic material that absorbs water. As the surroundings change, the hydrogenic sensor will change its dielectric constant based on how much water it is able to absorb. The dielectric constant can be measured and associated to the humidity level.  

*** Testing process ***

The DHT-11 was compared to the temperature readings of an apartment thermometer. The temperature of the apartment was changed and the readigs of the apartment's thermometer were compared to the readings of the DHT-11. Hysteresis was also tested using a refigerator to cool and then bringing the DHT-11 back to room temperature.
