# Overview

The Ultrasonic sensor is a distance measuring device. The sensor has two main components, one that sends an ultrasonic signal and one that receives it. The processor can find the time between when the signal is sent and when it is received. The time found for travel is then multiplied by the speed of the signal and divided by two. The measurement is divided by two because time taken for the signal to travel is to the point of interest and back, but the device is only interested in the distance to the device.  

***Testing Process***
The ultrasonic sensor was tested using a whiteboard, lamp, and tape-measure. The measuring tape was able to provide an accurate ground truth. The lamp posed as a reliably constant location for repeatabilty as well as drift measurements. The whiteboard was used for the main accuracy data collection.
